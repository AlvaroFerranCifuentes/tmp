<b>Mobile manipulator</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp; This is my bachelors thesis project. It is a mobile platform with two arms controlled remotely via Wi-Fi from an Android phone.<br />
&nbsp; The base contains two DC motors with their wheels and a third caster wheel for support, and the arms are 3D printed and have five degrees of freedom each, one per servo motor.<br />
&nbsp; The unit also&nbsp; accommodates a Raspberry Pi computer, an Arduino Nano microcontroller, a webcam and a 12V Li-ion battery as well as a 5v-3.3v logic converter, DC-DC Buck converter and a motor driver using a L293D H-bridge.<br />
&nbsp; All of this is controlled from an Android app which will send a string of characters containing all the necessary information for the actuators, as well as display the image received from the camera. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; The project can be divided into three sections: mechanical, electrical and software, the latter being certainly the most extensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Mechanical</b> <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Electrical&nbsp; (missing raspi cable, LCD connection, battery connector)</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp; The robot is powered by a 12V 6800mAh Lithium-ion battery. However, since the logic boards are limited to a 5V input, a DC-DC Buck converter is used to step down the voltages supplied to the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, while still furnishing 12V to drive the motors.<br />
Furthermore, the computer and microcontroller communicate through UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter), but are at 3.3v and 5v levels respectively so a logic voltage converter is placed in between to avoid blowing up the former.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Software</b><br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><i>Android </i><br />
<i></i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i><br /></i>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raspberry&nbsp; (MISSING: power consumption, GPIO explanation, Raspi datasheet, pictures, LCD connection, iso burning, ssh setup, vnc server+ viewer, python server install, mjpg install, rc.local + android2arduino code diagrams, Raspi history, motivation...)</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>&nbsp; </i>From the official Raspberry Pi Foundation's website, it is "a credit-card sized computer [...] which can be used in electronics projects". A Raspberry Pi Model B running Raspbian wheezy is used here with an EDUP 802.11n Wi-Fi dongle, a Microsoft vx800 webcam and a 16x2 LCD attached.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; In this case it is used to create a private WLAN AP (Wireless Local Area Network Access Point) to which the Android device will be able to connect. This configuration, while more cumbersome than simply connecting to an existing WLAN, offers the advantage of being able to operate even if no networks are available.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<i>&nbsp; </i>In order to do so, the packages <i>host</i><i>apd</i> and <i>isc-dhcp-server</i> have been installed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;[Wifi AP procedure here]<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Once the Wi-Fi AP has been established the Pi creates a TCP socket connection and waits for a client to connect. When both are linked the Pi starts listening from the socket. If it receives a string containing the word "quit", the connection will close and start waiting for a new client, elsewise the string is sent through serial communication to the Arduino.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Simultaneously the webcam streaming is initialized and forwarded through port 8080 using the Mjpg-streamer software. This software sends a series of JPEG images over IP, adhering to a series of specifications, including but not limited to number of frames per second, desired resolution, camera to use or TCP port.<br />
<br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arduino&nbsp; (MISSING: schematics, datasheet, history, board&amp;environment pictures, language explanation, installing everything, libraries, sketchbook)</i><br />
<br />
&nbsp; Arduino is a family of open-source microcontroller boards with multiple digital and analog Input/Output pins as well as UART, I2C and SPI communication pins in order to interact with a large number of devices.<br />
&nbsp; The board used in this manipulator is an Arduino Nano 3.0 which contains an ATmega328 microcontroller, 14 digital I/O pins and 8 analog pins as well as the previously specified protocol pins.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The Arduino side of the software first defines all the pins needed and assigns them to the various actuators. It then&nbsp; reads from the UART pins until an 'end' character is received. A parsing function that splits the received string into the needed variables is then called.&nbsp; Next the program determines which actuators to maneuver and in which quantity analyzing the data received. Finally the results are applied and the process restarts.
